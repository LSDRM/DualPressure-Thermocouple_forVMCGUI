# DualPressure-Thermocouple_forVMCGUI
A customized DAQ board through UART protocol, embeding two pressure sensors and one thermocouple. Has been developed to be used with VMCGUI. Need to be interfaced through an [USB to UART module](https://github.com/LSDRM/USBtoUART-module_forVMCGUI) embeding a FT231X chip.
